# Overview

This is a fork of [paulmillr/ostio], modified for the purpose of studying a
large real-life code base with source maps.

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it.
2. `npm run setup`
3. `npm run build`

The public/ directory will then contain CSS and JavaScript files, with source
map files, in uncompressed, minified, gzipped and minified + gzipped versions.
